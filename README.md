# Finetuned-Math-Ai-LLM
This repository contains code for fine-tuning our favourite SOT i.e.Meta LLaMA-3 8B model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) on Google Colab. The setup includes mounting Google Drive to save checkpoints and ensuring efficient training using 4-bit quantization and half-precision floating-point operations.
